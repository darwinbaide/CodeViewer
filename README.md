# CodeViewer
Repository of code that i have learned how to use and other relavent information about languages for easy look up when coding similar projects.

This will be used to store topics and examples of those topics so that in the future when starting new projects i can have easy to find relavent work i have done before or found on the internet for how to do certain things.


Includes a scraper for python.org to get content and pre populate that into my SQL DB so that the tedious small work doesnt need to be hand inputed. 


Currently have the main search page working and working on the scraper for python.org to populate data, waiting on local Save location to save files that are too large for sql requests.
